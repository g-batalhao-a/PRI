(simple recipes doesn't mean you  eat bad things).  This principle can be used as a base to make other &quot;au gratin&quot; vegetables. I am thinking of making a courgette tian (adapted from a non vegan  recipe).",

            "{5 stars, Bergy} Love the combination - this is a meal in itself, however being a carnivore I served it with skinless, boneless chicken breasts, baby carrots. Loved the flavor.  I used 1 tsp mustard powder instead of the seeds and mashed the potatoes before adding the peas and mint. Watch the amount of liquid left ibefore you start to mash them there may just a bit too much liquid (as this recipe did not intend to mash the potatoes)  I removed the extra sauce and served it over the potatoes & peas  Super recipe Eve*Thanks",
            "{5 stars, dimensionally trans} Excellent! I was looking for a curried potato recipe that wasn't too liable to burn or require pre-cooking. This worked perfectly but I increased the spice to match my taste.",
            "{5 stars, Soozaler} This was fantastic. We didn't have any ghee, so we used butter and it was still delicious.\n\nWe also decided to modify it by adding cauliflower. We added that the same time as the potatoes and it was perfect.\n\nI used 1/2 t of cayenne pepper for the \"pepper\" and it was a little too spicy for my 6 year old daughter, so I think I'll use 1/4 t of cayenne pepper for this recipe next time.\n\nMy husband and I loved this, so we'll probably make it a lot!"

Cut it back for 2 and served it over tomato flavoured brown rice.  Thanks for sharing Chuckster, will do this one again!!",

            "{5 stars, jmhaan} I had to cook for a crowd and the guests had to serve themselves. I cut up the chicken into pieces and added it to the sauce. I added al dente penne to same skillet as sauce mixture and cooked for 5 more minutes.  I then topped with shredded mozzarella cheese and covered until ready to serve.  Guests helped themselves right out of the skillet.  Easy and delicious!",

I used just 1/2 of a regular sized cinnamon bagel, added the banana and cheese, and sprinkled with cinnamon and real sugar.  Pure heaven.  Not a heavy meal at all, but substantial enough to keep me running full-blast on a morning when I didn't (gack!) have any coffee.  Thanks Manda for a great recipe!!",

Because of comments in the discussion forums, I decided to give this one a try, even though I am not a cottage cheese eater.  This was really good.  I liked the flavor and the cinnamon and sweetner made the cottage cheese very tasty.  Especially with the banana and cinnamon/raisin bagel that I put it on.  Thanks for posting this one.",

Eng. muffin yesterday for breakfast and a rasin bagel this morning. This is addictive and very filling!!! I like mine sweet, so I added a lot of cinnimin sugar spice to mine! I can't believe no one ever thought of putting cottage cheese on their bagel before.  I used the fat free kind and it tasted wonderful!  This is a very healthy breakfast!  Thanks for sharing it! Definitely better and more filling than cereal!",

            "{5 stars, jellie} I forgot to add the cinnamon and used brown sugar in lieu of the sweetener...I also blend my ingredients before adding them to the bread; make sure to stir well.

I'm going to take my old bananas from the freezer (saved for banana bread, rarely used) and mash them up for this recipe.",

I used toasted whole wheat bread (the end pieces - I like crusty bread) and used a LOT of cinnamon (however, next time I'll use more...yes, I do LOVE cinnamon - what gave you THAT idea? ;). I have to say that at first bite, I wasn't impressed, but then I kept eating. THEN I had a *2nd* one!! Oh it's so nummy. From now on, when they're out of egg whites, this will be my next best alternative. Thank you for adding a little more variety to my breakfasts! :D It tastes almost like a banana cannoli. Num! The recipe also reminds me of MY recipe \"My Daily Bagel Breakfast\" #47038. **UPDATE**: I tried this again, but subbed FRESH PINEAPPLE and it was DELISH! It added complexity in texture from the pineapple itself and because the natural juice softens the top layer of toasted bread slightly - which I like. Hope to try with other fruits :)",

I've eaten it the past two mornings using toasted fruit & spice loaf as the base and liked it very much.  It's healthy, substantial and ideal for those with a sweet tooth who find it hard to eat breakfast.  It's also an easy way to add a little extra protein to one's diet. Yesterday I used sugar in place of the sweetener, and today tried it with a drizzle of honey which was even nicer.",

            "{4 stars, Atheist Cook} I made this for my 8yr old daughter as she is getting tired of the usual breakfasts.  She loved loved loved it. We substituted a little maple syrup for the sugar substitute as she loves maple syrup.  We will be making this one often.",
            "{4 stars, seesko} This wasn't bad!  It was definatly different.  I have to give it four stars because of the ease and healthy aspect of it.  To be honest I probably won't make it again.  Only because i would rather have these items seperatly than layered on top of each other.  It really is a healthy start to the day.",
            "{5 stars, Lizzybob} Great quick breakfast. Nice way to sneak in some protein for breakfast!  Update: I tried Ricotta Cheese & it was even better!",
            "{5 stars, Baykes} i tried this on Ezekiel bread (basically healthy sprout bread) and with xylitol ( a sugar substitute) and it was absolutely delicious.",
            "{5 stars, katenawrocki} This was VERY tasty, will have this on a regular basis with my morning coffee, Thanks for posting!",
            "{4 stars, angelashley} I used to eat a very similar recipe for breakfast. My only changes were that I used to broil/microwave the combination so the cheese would melt a bit and then I'd usually skip the sugar. A classic!",
            "{5 stars, MechanicalJen} Wow!  This recipe is deceptively filling.  I've always harrumphed english muffins at the store, looking so puny.  I need my breakfast to hold me over until lunch!  \r\n\r\nManda, thanks for making my breakfast a little more exciting than a plain bagel.\r\n\r\nAs a side note, I can see it being very easy to play with the topping, here.  I'm thinking of using pumpkin pie spice for tomorrow.  A mixture of cocoa powder and splenda could have potential, as well.",
            "{5 stars, Plumshadow} I will agree with the others, the breakfast will leave you border line stuffed!!!  It was pretty good, very quick and healthy (especially if you use whole wheat bagals/eglish muffin).",
            "{4 stars, Seasons} My son loves this....we use regular sugar no low fat cottage cheese.  It's been great for the weekends.  A good treat!",
            "{4 stars, Peachie Keene} I really don't like bananas, but I am always trying to find a way to get them into my weekly routine. This way is absolutely wonderful! But it is VERY filling - Next time I will only use HALF of my english muffin and save the other half for the next time. I just couldn't eat both (for myself). I also used Honey instead of sugar substitute and I used 4% Cottage Cheese. Four stars only because of my banana preference :)",
            "{5 stars, Miss Angie} This is my favorite breakfast food of all time!! I've been making it all through college :) I usually use frozen banana slices on top of the cottage cheese. If your banana is ripe, you can skip the sugar. Mmmmm! I think I'll make this tomorrow!",
            "{5 stars, frozen_rain} I absolutely love this idea! I usually make it on whole wheat bread...it's like dessert for breakfast! Yum! And it's so filling!",
            "{5 stars, hungry4more} It is surprising how tasty something so simple can be. Thanks for the recipe.",
            "{5 stars, veggie_mama} Quick, easy and delicious.  I didn't add sweetener, and I  didn't miss it.  The bananas were sweet enough. The cinnamon really makes this great.  This will be a regular breakfast and snack from now on.",
            "{5 stars, slickchick} Was sitting here looking at recipes and knowing I needed to get up to get something to eat and I looked at the menu I have for my daughter and saw this.  I just got done eating this and I loved it!!!  Easy, simple and lots of flavor.  I heard on the Ellen show that cinnamon is good for you, so I have been using it a lot more.  This is a great way to add it. Thanks Manda for coming up with such a great creation:)",
            "{5 stars, Greeny4444} I thought cottage cheese on bread sounded really weird, but this is REALLY good! I used one piece of toasted wheat bread, and I followed everything else to the letter, just piling everything on one piece of bread. I would've never concocted this myself, but I will definitely be having it for breakfast more often. Thanks for posting it, Manda!",
            "{5 stars, ShortieNJ} Wow...something you think will be weird...tastes really good.  The only thing i will change next time is to put the cottage cheese directly on the toast, so it's not so cold and distinctly different from the rest of the meal",
            "{5 stars, CandinZach} I can't believe I haven't rated this yet! I have eaten this at least four times a week for several months, and I still look forward to eating it in the morning. This is so delicious and easy, it has really been a lifesaver for me. Thank you so much!",
            "{0 stars, jrusk} I was delighted to find this recipe. My usual snack is cottage cheese, splenda and cinnamon. I just added the banana this morning and it was really good. I would have never thought to add it, yum...Thanks Manda!",
            "{5 stars, merrilife} This was really so much better than I would have ever thought. I like cottage cheese, but would have never thought to use it like this! Thanks so much. (I can't imagine eating anything every day, but this will be in the rotation nonetheless!",
            "{4 stars, LUVMY2BOYS} Very awesome & delicious! I loved all the ingredients. I make a \"cinnamon whole wheat tortilla\" for myself in the mornings, so I used this for a sweet & creamy filling. Like a danish, but healthy  as well! Thanks so much for sharing this great creation.",
            "{3 stars, Bittersweetened} I was anxious to try this recipe since I love all the ingredients individually. My dh and I did not feel that the flavors complimented each other. I was hoping to like this since we are always on the look out for healthy meals. I am sure it is just our own preferences since it seems to be received well by others. Sorry for not liking it, we will probably not be making this again.",
            "{5 stars, Laura_Ozz} I found this recipe yesterday and tried it this morning and loved it!  I just didn't have any sugar substitute so sprinkled sugar very sparingly and used toasted wheat bread slices.  Delicious!!  Thank you for sharing this yummy use for cottage cheese and bananas!!",
            "{5 stars, lovelysoulthief} i liked this quite a bit, though i did change it to be... less healthy.  using what was on hand, i had toasted sourdough bread, and used whole milk ricotta cheese in place of cottage cheese.  next time i may try strawberries instead of bananas.",
            "{5 stars, Dawni} Amazingly simple but very yummy!\nThis fills you up and you are not hungry for quite a while.  I use whole wheat english muffins.\nThanks for the great idea!!",
            "{4 stars, Heather W.} Quite tasty, light and quick.  I avoid using artificial sweeteners, so I just left it out and still tasted good.  If you wanted sweet, you could drizzle a very tiny bit of honey....and wouldn't change the calorie count significantly...but I don't think it is necessary.   Oh, and I made mine on mini bagels.",
            "{4 stars, havent the slightest} Very nice. I used a whole wheat english muffin and honey instead of cinnamon. I put the cottage cheese on first, then added sliced banana, topped with some drizzled honey. A tasty, healthy breakfast that I will definitely make again!",
            "{5 stars, PatriotsGirl} I've recently discovered that I love cottage cheese. I've avoided it my entire life of 31 years without ever trying it, just assuming I wouldn't like it.  I decided to give it a whirl recently, and while I don't care for it straight out of the carton, I LOVE it when used in a sweeter dish like this.  I used two low fat, whole grain waffles for this, added the sliced bananas on top, and then mixed the cottage cheese, splenda and cinnamon all together before putting on top of the bananas.  I loved it from the very first bite!  This is probably the healthiest, most filling breakfast I can think of.  I eat these a few times a week now, thanks so much for this fabulous and simple recipe!",
            "{4 stars, lil_ms_priss86_} Tasty. I admit, I was skeptical of this recipe...the cottage cheese with the sweetener...but this is Healthy AND Delicious! I shared this recipe with others. I also have added berries, too, for a little something extra.... But don't leave out the banana-the banana makes this recipe! I will definitely make this  again. Thanks for sharing.",
            "{5 stars, Lucky in Bayview} What a nice surprise! I didn't expect to like this near as much as I did. I used whole wheat English muffins and drizzled honey instead of using sweetener. It was delicious and kept me full for hours. Thanks for sharing this healthy, delicious recipe. I'll be making this often."

I definately found it easy to make and a recipe in which you probably already have all the ingredients in your kitchen.  All in all a good recipe when you are in a hurry."

Once cooked I drained the pan juices into a wide jug and placed in the freezer for about 1/2 hour so all the lamb fat rose to the top. I then scooped all the fat off and boiled the juices on the stove top to reduce to a fabulous gravy. Thanks for sharing, I will make this again for sure."

I did add some garlic salt and Cavender's All Purpose Greek Seasoning to the flour.  Otherwise, prepared as it said.  Used fresh Largemouth Bass that I caught ice fishing today!!  Thanks Leona",
            "{5 stars, Country Dad} This is a nice light recipe for frying fish.  We really liked the light flavor from frying with the shortening.  It seemed a lot less greasy than frying in vegetable oil.  My son went absolutely nuts for this fish and just went on and on about how good it was.  We skipped the sesame seeds.  Next time I would reduce the milk a bit, perhaps 1/4 cup to get a little more breading but as it is written was excellent so I'm hesitant to change anything.",

We like tartar sauce so of course that was served on the side. Not greasy and nice and light! Not soggy at all! Yes, shortening worked great for me as well. Thank you and will be making it again. I always have sesame seeds on hand for my bagel making! Love it when I have all the ingredients!! Mmmmm....highly recommend this one! Outstanding!!! Jelly :wave:"

(Well, the salt would have been, if I had added it--the feta, olives and capers provided quite as much saltiness as I needed. But I omitted it, so all was well.) Enjoyed the lemon juice in place of the more usual vinegar, too. By the way, sorry I don't have a camera, because it's also very pretty."

            "{5 stars, chirospasm} Excellent and fast recipe!  Have made several times since originally making it, tinkering with it a little each time.  Now I use regular tomato paste and cut back to 1/4 tsp of salt.  I also omit the tomatoes and rosemary (for personal taste issues) and add 1/8 tsp garlic powder.  Part of my regular recipe rotation now!",
            "{5 stars, anitacita} Yummy, healthy, quick, and simple.  Couldn't ask for anything more.  Based on other reviews, I also left out the rosemary, otherwise I followed the recipe exactly."

            "{4 stars, lady_heather} This was a hearty, easy to make meal. We loved it. I halved the recipe as i was cooking for two, but i think i shouldnt have halved the amount of cheese soup & milk mix, i would have liked more cheese sauce. I also used canned green beans, which worked out great."

It is very quick to put together, which would make it a nice dish to keep in mind for unexpected company--I doubt they would guess it all started with Campbell's. :) The only change I would make next time is possibly using a bit less milk, but that is just personal preference as we like our soups a little thick. Thanks for posting this creative little recipe! ;)",

Very quick and easy to make - just mix the ingredients and put straight in the oven. My friend noted that dark beer works best. I like to sprinkle white and black sesame seeds on the bread, as it gives it that extra taste.",

I used a lighter beer, Bud Select, since that was all I had in the house. The bread was moist and great warm from the oven. It did have a beer aftertaste, which I thought was fine, but might not be enjoyed by someone that doesn't care for beer.",

These may be made ahead but wait to put the crumbs on top until just before baking.  Artificial crab works well too. Some like to steam the jalapenos for 5 minutes first but I like to have a little crunch to them.",

The only problem I had was deciding when to add the flour mixture since that step is missing, but I just added it to the brown sugar mixture before I folded in the egg mixture.  Also, the bottoms cooked a little too fast and the first batch was done by 8 minutes.  I reduced heat to 360 and baked them for 9 minutes.  Perfect. Very chewy and good!  They really spread out more than I thought they would, so I can see how it can make 48 cookies.  Thanks!",

            "{5 stars, Chef Jeff F.} This was excellent - a very pleasant surprise!  We made pancakes and, at the last minute, realized we were out of maple syrup.  I found this recipe, whipped it up in a matter of minutes and now I don't know if we will ever go back to normal syrup.",
            "{0 stars, Raechel D.} This was good, what I did to make it thicker so it was more like a syrup was after added a little more milk and honey returned it to the stove top and stirrd in a little cornstarch  and I let it come to a low boil for a few seconds then I put it in my serving cup, it tasted just like a  cinnamon bun"

Added in minced carrot and used a 50/50 mix of extra lean/80% lean pork. \n\nMaking the filling the night before wrapping/cooking is a great timesaver! Don&#039;t go crazy with the oil and water - I used a large, well-seasoned cast iron pan and 1/4 c of water for each batch, and everything came out awesome."

This was gorgeous, I did take a gamble as I knew it would have quite a tomato flavour, but I had made another recipe by MrsJ that I really enjoyed, so I took the gamble. I am so glad I did this was wonderful. I made exactly as stated except there is only 3 in my family so I used the left over sauce  to coat the pasta, topped with the chicken and sprinkled some chopped parsley and extra parmesan cheese on top. Very easy recipe tastes wonderful and the whole family gave it a big thumbs up. Loved, thanks for a great quick easy recipe that tastes  wonderful.",

            "{4 stars, LilPinkieJ} This was very good chicken parm. The sauce is similar to the one I make. I added a little more garlic, just because we love it. I loved too that we had everything on hand already. DH forgot to pound out the chicken, but it still turned out ok. Will definitely make again. Made and Reviewed for I Recommend Tag Game - Thanks :)"

It did have plenty of heat and it was very easy to prepare. This was an unusual chili dish. I was really hoping for some wow! but it didn't happen. Thanks for posting. :)"

            "{4 stars, Zurie} Reviewed for RSC #13. This was really good! I added a pinch of sea salt to the spinach filling. The quantities worked well for the 2 breasts I used. Pity, but I haven't seen Panko crumbs in the shops, so used dried breadcrumbs. If this had not been a contest recipe, I'd probably have added finely chopped parsley to the spinach. Also maybe more honey plus a squeeze of lime and some ginger to the glaze. But these would have been personal tweaks, and I made the recipe as written. As happens with me, I did not manage to close the breasts properly, and some filling cooked out, but that was my clumsiness. Thank you chef, for a very nice main dish!",
            "{4 stars, pamela t.} We liked the presentation of this dish and loved the use of panko. I did put panko and all sides of the chicken as I wanted the crunch and put the glaze on all sides of the chicken which I think made more sense and gave more flavor. I liked the cheese but didn't love it. Thanks for the nice and beautiful recipe.",
            "{5 stars, AcadiaTwo} Such a delicious chicken dish that we all scarfed down. Just in the nick of time I was able to take a photo before the last piece was gone. Loved the crispy addition of the panko bread crumbs with the creamy Laughing Cow cheese! This is definitely a keeper!",
            "{4 stars, NELady} Made for RSC #13 - Really enjoyed this chicken dish.  Stuffing chicken is always a challenge for me, so some of the insides spilled out (which is fine and totally my own ineptitude).  I followed the recipe as written.  I could take or leave the cheese.  Good flavors, great idea for using the secret ingredients!"

            "{5 stars, Bratalli} i've been looking for bread machine sticky buns. These were very good. Thanks! P.S. Where's the rest of your Aunt's recipes?  I also did the same thing and added more flour and they came out great!",
            "{5 stars, Jeep65} turned out great ,,thanks  : )",
            "{1 stars, c_waterstraat} I tried making these tonight and followed the somewhat sketchy recipe to the T. (I&#039;m sorry but its poorly written..if I didnt have baking knowledge these would have been even more of a disaster.) After 25 minutes in the oven I took them out and flipped them out of the pan; the bottom of everyone of them was completely raw and soggy. I put them back in for another 10 minutes and repeated the flipping...still raw. Put them back in the pan with the soggy side up and put them back in the oven for another 15 minutes and now they are just destroyed. It was a waste of all my ingredients and time."

            "{5 stars, UmmBinat} Oh yum DD (toddler) and I loved this!! This is a gorgeous creamy fattening drink. I used rice milk for the milk part only and vanilla paste which is perfect in this. I heated and stirred in a covered pot on the stove until all melted and mingled together, we could NOT wait longer. I garnished with canned whipped cream for the look and DD. I would make this again on a cold winters day/night. Made for Everyday's a Holiday March 2010.",

Like Japan bound I tend to go heavier on the fruit, and for my tastes I stick with about 1 t honey. I enjoy this breakfast so much that I have discovered that just about any seasonal fruit works here...apples/pears, grapes, kiwi, mango, you name it! Made and enjoyed for ZWT6, for the Mischief Makers!",

            "{5 stars, Brooke the Cook in} This made a wonderful snack last night! I used fresh blueberries and mixed in a bit of flaxseed meal along with the granola! The honey gives the sour greek yogurt a nice sweet flavor. Will be making again. Made for ZWT6.",

            "{5 stars, Leslie} I'd never tried Greek yogurt until now, and it's true, it's so rich and creamy and delicious! Paired with the the yogurt, honey and fruit, my granola was delicious! Made for ZWT 6 :)",
            "{5 stars, evelynathens} The best way to showcase our fabulous Greek honey - with our rich, creamy, tangy yoghurt and fresh, seasonal fruit.  I used strawberries, fresh melon and banana and sprinkled some granola over for crunch.  We all loved this for breakfast.  Thanks.",
            "{5 stars, Ma Field} Used a wonderful Trader Joe's nonfat Greek yogurt and home grown fruit with pure clover honey and good granola.  This is my idea of breakfast heaven!  Can't wait for peaches to come in so I can use those.... Made for ZWT6 by a Looney Spoon Phoodie",
            "{5 stars, littlemafia} I ate a lot of yogurt this ZWT (6).Homemade granola and homemade yogurt is what I used. For berries I used blueberries.",
            "{5 stars, tomsawyer} Very good breakfast treat that filled me up! I used strawberries as my fruit and because I did not have granola, I crushed up cereal over the top. Made for ZWT6 Herulean Challenge",
            "{0 stars, Bayhill} Delicious!!  I eat this for breakfast at least twice a week, but I've never had it with the granola before.  Adding the granola really bumped up the flavor and has now become our favorite way to enjoy this morning treat.  I used 2% lowfat Fage Greek yogurt, an oat and honey granola, and dried cranberries. Also, I substituted an Agave sweetener for the honey, added chopped walnuts and some cinnamon.  I layered half of the yogurt in a bowl and topped it with half of the granola, a handful of dried cranberries and chopped walnuts, a sprinkling of cinnamon, and drizzled Agave sweetener over the top.  I repeated the layers, ending with the sweetener.  Yummy!!  Thank you for sharing this recipe...it is definitely a keeper!!<br/>Made for 2010 Football Pool",
            "{4 stars, linda.winkler} I eat this almost every morning but skip the honey. Most granolas are sweet enough already and the honey just adds a lot of sugar to your diet which takes away from the health aspect. I use plain unsweetened yoghurt.  I add blueberries or in winter, frozen fruit such as strawberries. Greek yoghurt is high in protein and  keeps you feeling full for hours."

            "{4 stars, Iceland} Cocktail sauce is very popular in Iceland, made with sour cream instead of mayonnaise. That is what i used. The ginger gave a nice kick to it. Made for ZWT6",
            "{5 stars, threeovens} I loved the ginger in this sauce!  I originally served this with boiled shrimp and it was okay, but later I used it on fried food and it was even better.  It would also go well as a sandwich spread or on a green salad.  I also like that the recipe is written for 1 serving, so you can make a little or a lot.  Made for ZWT #6.",
            "{5 stars, queenbeatrice} What a lovely recipe and so easy!!!! I served this with grilled shrimp skewers. Just the right amount of zing. I will be making this often, thnaks for sharing.",
            "{5 stars, gailanng} Made as an alternative dipping sauce for recipe #302148.  What a wonderful discovery it turned out to be!  Now I need to discover that marvelous invention that automatically cleans my kitchen.  Made for Everyday Is A Holiday.",
            "{5 stars, Sydney Mike} Wonderful cocktail sauce that we enjoyed with jumbo shrimp, as an appetizer for just the 2 of us! Loved your sauce, especially with the ginger in it, & will be making it again soon, for one of the monthly groups I host! Thanks for sharing the recipe! [Made & reviewed in Everyday Is a Holiday]"

You could leave the fettuccine out of this recipe and eat it inside tortillas for great fajitas too.  I left off the cheese topping, but it was heaven without.",

            "{5 stars, Karen Elizabeth} Mikeykey,  this is soooo good!!!   I stuck to recipe other than two very minor changes, I did not use pre-cook lasagna sheets, just used the normal ones,  and I didnt use canned pupmkin puree,   I had fresh pumpkin, steamed, mashed and used that.   The goats cheese I used was a very soft and creamy peppadew-infused feta,  which worked very well in the recipe.    I cut myself a bit short on time and didnt let this stand for as long as it should ,  it still TASTED out of this world, but I would have got a better  -- shape?   by letting it stand,  this was a minor consideration however,   I LOVED this recipe and will definitely be making it again, I have also passed it on to friends!!!   Thanks so much, enjoyed for PRMR tag game"

            "Rub the prime rib all over with some veggie oil. Season both sides of the meat with an aggressive amount of salt, including the end caps. You want a generous amount all over so it helps form a crust while cooking. Continue seasoning with some pepper(not as much as the salt), and a good amount of fresh herbs all over the meat. Use a knife to cut slits of the top side(fat side) of the meat. Make the cuts just big enough to stuff the garlic cloves all around. Ideally, let the roast marinate uncovered overnight in the fridge. This will help infuse lots of flavor and help form a great crust. Alternatively, you could let the roast come up to room temperature for 1-1.5 hours with the seasoning on before you cook it.",
            "\nPre-heat oven to 325 F and setup the oven rack so the roast will sit on the bottom rack. Put the prime rib on a roasting rack in a pan. Insert a probe thermometer in the deepest part of the meat(don\u2019t touch the bones), and roast in the oven for 2.5 hours, or until the internal temperature reaches 130 F(120 F for medium rare). You may need to add 1 cup of water to the bottom of the roasting pan if the fat starts to smoke.",
            "While the meat is cooking, make the butter by adding all the ingredients to a bowl and mix well. Butter can be made ahead of time and stored in the fridge for 1 week.",
            "\nWhen the meat reaches 130 F, take it out of the oven and loosely cover it with tin foil. Let rest for 30-60 minutes so the juices can re-distribute. Slice the meat, top it with the butter and enjoy!"
