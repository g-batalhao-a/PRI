We lost it for a good while and after I found it, I originally posted it so I would never lose it again.   Thank you all for all your interest ... this is my absolute favorite pie.  During the &quot;lost&quot; phase I must have gained 20 pounds trying numerous different buttermilk pie recipes ... I was so glad when I found it again as only a few even came close in taste and texture.  I've noted a lot of people mentioning reducing the sugar, which is fine, but bear in mind that the sugar quantity was a major difference between this and other recipes I tested when it was lost.

Chicha is made in South and, to a lesser extent, Central America. Unlike African opaque beer, it is not brewed commercially, but instead is made and served in what sound to me like wee tiny brewpubs. An abbreviated version is also made in people's kitchens. Chicha is consumed whilst still fermenting and so is low in alcohol. It is often spiced and may also be served with fruit.  With Bill's help and a little patience, a friend and I recently completed a batch. This was a very interesting and satisfying endeavour which included growing and malting the corn used. Every step of the process was very simple, and I highly recommend attempting this at home. My second crop of corn is about to come in and the results were good enough that I will be doing this again in the near future.","Images":null,"RecipeCategory":"Beverages","Keywords":"Mexican, Free Of..., Weeknight, Easy","RecipeIngredientParts":"piloncillo cone, Nottingham dry yeast","AggregatedRating":null,"ReviewCount":0,"Calories":21.1,"FatContent":0.3,"SaturatedFatContent":0.0,"CholesterolContent":0.0,"SodiumContent":3.6,"CarbohydrateContent":2.7,"FiberContent":1.5,"SugarContent":0.0,"ProteinContent":2.7,"RecipeServings":null,"RecipeYield":"1 batch","RecipeInstructions":"Procedure: Mash for 90 minutes at 160\u00b0F., We did two 1.5 gallon batches, each spiced differently (one with curacao\/coriander, the other with allspice\/cinammon). We would rather have used a higher proportion of jora, but on brewday we discovered that our ability to determine the weight of things is seriously imparied., Instead of the 4.5lbs we thought we had, we found we had only 3lbs of jora., Rather than readjust (the OG would have been more appropriate at ~1.045 in any case), we added more sugar, a course of action that was inspired by homebrewed Weizen as much as anything else. The result is a very tasty beverage, pretty big all the way around on corn, and yet the flavor is quite subtle. Be warned that chicha is at its peak 2 to 4 days after pitching while it still retains some sweetness and body., \nOnce the chicha ferments out, you are left with a fairly bland beverage that reminds me of iced tea more than anything else. If I'd been thinking (chicha lends itself to gulping), I would have kegged the stuff on the third day after pitching and stuck it in the fridge. While we took the trouble to grow our own (blue) corn, I see no reason why one could not start with good ol' yellow corn from the grocery store (domestic 20-row?) In fact, I plan on doing this if only to see what kind of chicha it makes., \nSpecifics:  OG: 1.055  FG: 1.012 Types of Chicha So far, there appear to me to be several main ways in which chicha de jora is made. These range in difficulty from trivial to a process almost indentical to what barley-beer homebrewers are familiar with., Facil (easy) - Corn is mixed with water and sugar and allowed to sit for several days until the corn begins to germinate. The sugar ferments and the corn, lending nothing fermentable, adds flavor., Abbreviated - The jora is mashed but the mash is ultimately brought to a boil, allowed to settle, and the clear liquid, or upi, now finished chicha, is drawn off., \nTraditional - Similiar to the Abbreviated method, but the jora is mashed and the mash is allowed to settle. The upi is drawn off the mash into a separate vessel for boiling., Modern - The ground jora is mashed and lautered through some sort of filtering device such as a manifold or false bottom., This process is helped by the inclusion of some crushed malted barley (Barley Assisted). The first is apparently how much chicha is made in people's kitchens., Bill Ridgely describes most of the others in his articles., \nAlso note that the methods that include mashing use a batch sparge. That is, the sweet liquor (upi) is merely drained from the mash and there are no continuous additions of sparge water to the surface of the mash., Certainly sparging can be performed if desired, but it is neither traditional nor necessary (corn kernels have no husk and therefore do not form a filterbed). Chicha is traditionally allowed to spontaneously ferment. For the last type (Modern), George Duarte suggests that ground, unmalted corn could be mixed with a small amount of crushed 2-row malted barley and boiled for 20 minutes or so to gelatinize the starch in the corn., \nThis gooey mass would then be added to more water and barley malt and mashed as per 'normal' homebrew procedures., This could probably be sparged as usual.","URL":"https:\/\/www.food.com\/recipe\/chicha-peruana-69","Type":"recipe"},{"RecipeId":71.0,"Name":"Chicken and Dumplings","UserId":1582.0,"CookTime":2580,"PrepTime":5100,"TotalTime":7680,"DatePublished":"1999-08-25","Description":"Make and share this Chicken and Dumplings recipe from Food.com.","Images":null,"RecipeCategory":"Whole Chicken","Keywords":"Chicken, Poultry, Meat, Winter, Weeknight, Broil\/Grill, Oven, Stove Top, < 4 Hours","RecipeIngredientParts":"chicken, carrot, celery, onion, chicken bouillon cubes, butter, flour, sherry wine, lemon juice, salt, baking powder, salt, shortening, milk, peas","AggregatedRating":5.0,"ReviewCount":12,"Calories":657.9,"FatContent":42.7,"SaturatedFatContent":14.4,"CholesterolContent":188.7,"SodiumContent":637.7,"CarbohydrateContent":19.1,"FiberContent":2.1,"SugarContent":2.6,"ProteinContent":46.1,"RecipeServings":8.0,"RecipeYield":null,"RecipeInstructions":"Place chickens in large saucepan, cover with water and bring to a boil., Simmer until chickens are tender., Remove chickens from pan and set aside.

I  usually set the chicken cooking in an afternoon, and let it cook overnight.  Often it will cook for 12-24 hours., This is an excellent dish for those of us  who never learned to properly debone a chicken ;) At the end of the cooking  time, merely pull out the chicken pieces and separate the bones from the meat.

Sprinkle lightly with salt and let sit for 30 minutes., \nNow make the  Bechamel Sauce.  NOTE:  The Bechamel-egg-ricotta mixture will overflow all but the largest  (professional size) food processors. Use a mixer or blend by hand.Place the milk in a saucepan, and heat it just until tiny  bubbles appear along the edges. Remove and set aside., Melt the butter in 3-quart saucepan over very low heat until foamy, being careful not to brown. Slowly add the 6 Tbsp flour, stirring constantly until smooth (3-4 minutes), and  still being careful not to let it brown., \nAdd the milk slowly, whipping with a wire whisk. When the mixture is thick and smooth, remove it from the heat and stir in seasonings., Stir ricotta cheese until it is smooth  and creamy. Gently fold it into the Bechamel sauce. Stir in beaten eggs until  thoroughly incorporated., Back to the eggplant: Rinse well with cold water; squeeze gently and pat dry. Dredge the eggplant in 1 1\/2 cups flour, and saute each in olive oil until it is  brown on both sides., Remove and discard any excess oil that has risen to the  top of the tomato mixture. Lightly grease a 16x10 baking pan that is at least 3  inches deep, and sprinkle the bottom with a few breadcrumbs., \nPlace a layer of  eggplant in the pan, following with a layer of tomato mixture. Sprinkle with  breadcrumbs and grated cheese. Repeat as many times as you have eggplant to  last. Pour the Bechamel-ricotta sauce over the top and bake at 300 deg. F for  one hour, or until a golden-brown crust has formed on top., Remove moussaka from  oven and let it stand undisturbed 20-30 minutes; the delay allows the layers to  fuse., ","URL":"https:\/\/www.food.com\/recipe\/moussaka-414","Type":"recipe"},{"RecipeId":415.0,"Name":"Sweetened Iced Coffee","UserId":1737.0,"CookTime":0,"PrepTime":900,"TotalTime":900,"DatePublished":"1999-08-30","Description":"Make and share this Sweetened Iced Coffee recipe from Food.com.","Images":"https:\/\/img.sndimg.com\/food\/image\/upload\/w_555,h_416,c_fit,fl_progressive,q_95\/v1\/img\/recipes\/41\/5\/picvVTAbQ.jpg","RecipeCategory":"Beverages","Keywords":"< 15 Mins, Easy","RecipeIngredientParts":"instant coffee, coffee, sugar, low calorie sweetener, milk","AggregatedRating":5.0,"ReviewCount":7,"Calories":151.3,"FatContent":6.3,"SaturatedFatContent":3.9,"CholesterolContent":24.1,"SodiumContent":85.8,"CarbohydrateContent":17.8,"FiberContent":0.0,"SugarContent":8.3,"ProteinContent":6.1,"RecipeServings":6.0,"RecipeYield":null,"RecipeInstructions":"Dissolve instant coffee and sugar in hot water., Stir in 1 litre of cold  milk; add ice., For mocha flavour, use chocolate milk and reduce the sugar to taste., For single serving: Dissolve 1 Tbsp of instant coffee and 2 teaspoons sugar in 1 Tablespoon hot water.

There are other  methods of seasoning and roasting but we are always satisfied with the results  this way., Try to buy a whole fillet that is already \\peeled \\ ( trimmed of  silverskin, fat etc. ) or if you prefer you can buy untrimmed and do it  yourself., The whole filet has a taped part ( called the tail ) and when you  roast, tuck this part under so you can have a more even  piece of meat for  roasting., \nIf the whole filet is too large to fit your roasting pan you may cut  the filet in half and roast the two parts in the pan together., Make sure the  meat comes to room temperature prior to roasting for even roasting which also  helps with tenderness., Rub oil ( we prefer olive ) over the filet and then rub in seasonings such as salt , pepper, paprika, crushed garlic etc. The Montreal  Steak Seasoning is a nice choice ( available in the seasoning or meat sections  of supermarkets ) ., Or other people prefer to coat the filet with Dijon mustard  and then roll the filet in  finely crushed black or colored peppercorns prior to roasting., \nBoth ways are delicious., Place the filet on a  roasting rack over the  roasting pan., You can also place the filet over some beef bones in the pan which also act as a rack., Preheat the oven to 475 degrees F., Place the prepared filet on the rack and  roast 20 minutes ( for a average 5 lb roast- ). Then decrease the temperature to 350F and roast an additional 20 minutes., Remove the filet from the oven and let  sit about 15 minutes before slicing., This total time factor  should produce  medium rare.  A heavier roast will probably need more roasting time and a  smaller roast less time. The sitting times allows for best slicing and lets some of the juices settle etc.    If you prefer you can  check and rely on a meat  thermometer to test so you don't under or over roast the meat.., \nInsert  thermometer in the thickest part of the roast. Generally 120 to 130 F is rare  and 130 to 140 F is medium rare. Remember the meat will continue to cook with  \\standing time\\ out of the oven., Meanwhile make the mushroom sauce ( this is a natural and not thickened sauce ). In a large skillet over medium high heat cook the onion in some olive oil or butter until softened., Add the sliced mushrooms  and garlic and continue to cook and stir until the mushrooms have reduced in  volume by 1\/2 and become tender., \nAdd the vermouth, dashes of Worcestershire  sauce and Gravy Master (  a browning\/ caramelized color for sauces etc. ). Cook  and stir  another 5 to 10 minutes and then season to taste.   If you wish you   may add a few tablespoons of the pan drippings or a bit of beef bullion paste (  available in jars ) for a richer flavor., The whole recipe really can serve  quite a lot depending on how thick or thin you slice the meat.

The  potatoes may be quite  brown by this time and the chops should be getting softer and ready to  cut with a fork., \nAdd a little more water if needed., If the   potatoes and chops still aren't done enough, just turn up the heat  and cook a  little more. Drain all the juice from the can of sauerkraut  and spread over the potatoes., Sprinkle liberally with brown  sugar., Check often during the next 15  minutes to see when the  brown sugar melts., Mix it around into the kraut and  potatoes  and flip  the chops around to get some too., The dish is done when the  chops tear apart to a fork and potatoes are soft. I like the chops  falling  apart  and I have all the water cooked off., \nThis dish serves two or more  depending on  appetites., Serve with the kraut and potatoes mixed up together and add cold applesauce as a side.

I turned the heat up to 350 F and set the timer for 30 minutes, then forgot about it until the timer rang. I turned it out onto a wire rack and brushed the tops with real butter. WOW! Great bread! Aromatic, flavorful, full bodied, small crumb texture...firm, yet lighter than expected. I can't wait to make this for my German mother-in-law who is a bread snob of the worst kind, as most European's are (and for good reason). I've taken a picture to share. You'll know it's mine by my Blue Willow China in the background and the cranberry garnish. This bread recipe will go into the official family cookbook for sure. After my little photo shoot I enjoyed a couple slices with a cream cheese but my boys, 3 and 4 yrs old finished off one of the loaves plain. Tonight we're having leftover Roast Sticky Chicken, fresh fruit and herb tea for dinner. This bread with butter, slices of honey cured ham, and good havarti cheese will be a perfect compliment.

In Germany we do not use the celery or the carrots in Lentilsoup, but I actually like that idea, gives it an extra little flavor. And yes we often use ham or even brown some bacon as added flavor.\r\nThe way I make it is, I cut about a quarter pound of bacon into strips, brown these, the put in one chopped onion and let it brown slightly until golden. I add water and the desired amount of lentils. Let it cook for about an hour. In a seperate saucepan I melt 3 tbs margarine and put in 3 tbs of flour, then I use about 3 tbs of vinegar take some of the already made lentil soup and mix it up good so you dont get lumps, transfer to lentil soup and stir well, let cook an additional half hour. Cut up some Frankfurters heat, and serve over Spaetzle.\r\nVery famous dish in every Gasthaus in Germany.","DateModified":"2001-05-30","Type":"review"},{"RecipeId":400.0,"UserId":10291,"Rating":1,"Review":"As a German National, growing up in the birthplace of Spaetzle in the Swabian community, having had Spaetzle twice a week since I can remember, I have to tell you that Spaetzle are not made with milk. You just use water. In the old days Spaetzles dough was made thinner and put on a cuttingboard then scraped into boiling water. It only takes a couple of minutes..less then 5, for Spaetzle to be done. I actually have a spaetzlesmachine where you fill in the dough and it comes out looking like spagetti, but you stir them up and they break a little, cookingtime is 2 minutes...once they boil take them out. Spaetzlesmachine is much like a potatoricer, there are places on the web where you can buy those. Thats authentic Spaetzle. Sometimes my Mom just made Spaetzle, browned some onions in butter and put them over the spaetzle, serve with a fresh green salad and you got a complete meal.","DateModified":"2001-05-30","Type":"review"},{"RecipeId":9051.0,"UserId":10069,"Rating":0,"Review":"The recipe states in the ingredients listing, 1 1\/2 quarts of shellfish veloute.......it would have made it so much easier for the normal cook if a recipe for the veloute had been included.

He simply boiled the meatballs in the chili sauce\/grape jelly mixture.  The meatballs consisted of salt abd beef...period.  I thought I could make them better, and richer.  So, I made my meatballs (sometimes making them like normal meatballs, with breadcrumbs, etc., and sometimes just seasoning the beef, and rolling it into balls), and baked them uncovered in the oven.  I drain whatever oil is there, if any, cover with the pre-made sauce (simmered while the meatballs bake), and bake for another 30 minutes or so, to bake the sauce on.  One other variation of mine, is lemon pepper added to the meatballs, and to the sauce.  If I am out, I will just use lemon juice.  The lemon pepper (or juice) adds a great taste to them!","DateModified":"2001-07-09","Type":"review"},{"RecipeId":3508.0,"UserId":11674,"Rating":0,"Review":"I have made a similar recipe for years (don;t include the onions and I also add dill weed.)
