    "\n",
    "The attribution of a given score is a bit subjective but tries to follow the following guidelines:\n",
    "\n",
    "0. A document that does not match the query.\n",
    "1. A document that vaguely matches the query, is very incomplete (missing important fields, like instructions) and has no reviews. Or has very negative reviews.\n",
    "2. A document that partially matches the query, is incomplete and has no reviews. Or a document with negative reviews.\n",
    "3. A document that matches the query semantically, is reasonably complete (may miss more than two fields) and has at least one positive review.\n",
    "4. A document that perfectly or almost perfectly matches the query semantically, is complete or missing just one of the fields and has a good number of positive reviews (5 to 20).\n",
    "5. A document that perfectly matches the query semantically, is complete (the recipe has a full ingredient list, steps and cook time/nutritional information) and has a lot of positive reviews (more than 20)."
